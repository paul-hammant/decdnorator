        <h2>Fully processed by the decorator</h2>
        A page with Two AngularJS Controllers/divs merged into one, with an added header and footer:<br/>
        <a href="has_two_angular_controllers.html">has_two_angular_controllers.html</a>
        <h2>Partially processed by the decorator</h2>
        That same page without the second decorator being applied (we look for a query-string param of noSecondaryDecoration).<br/>
        <a href="has_two_angular_controllers.html?noSecondaryDecoration">click here if running on localhost</a><br/>
        <a href="has_two_angular_controllers.html@noSecondaryDecoration.html">click here if running on http://paul-hammant.github.io/decachelan</a>
        (note the file name has been fixed by wget on github-pages, as all of this is a Wget copy of the 'app'<br/>
        <h2>Undecorated files</h2>
        <a href="foo.json">a sample JSON file</a>
        <br/>
        <a href="hello.html">a sample page</a>
